# Snake-game-IS1200
The classic game snake created in C on a ChipKIT Uno32


The project was done on a ChipKIT Uno32 development board togheter with a ChipKIT Basic I/O shield. I made a version of the game snake where you controlled whether the snake went left or right with two buttons and ate apples displayed as a white rectangle on the screen. The more apples you ate the more points you got and the faster the snake moved. The game could be played in singleplayer or with 2 players playing on the same chipkit. It also had a scoreboard where you could store your 10 highest scores and give names to each of these runs. There were also difficulty levels that added obstacles on the map to amke the game harder. 

The game can be run by simply downloading the zip folder and extracting the files. Then connect the computer to a ChipKit and upload the files onto the ChipKit and run the program with the following commands:
. /opt/mcb32tools/environment
make 
make install TTYDEV=/dev/ttyS4
